# Bird Flight: A Phaser-Powered Adventure

## Overview
*Bird Flight* is a 2D side-scrolling game built using the Phaser 3 framework. Players control a bird navigating through a series of increasingly challenging levels, dodging columns and mastering physics-based movement. With five distinct levels, each featuring unique column layouts and backgrounds, the game combines intuitive mechanics with strategic depth. This README explores the game's design, key concepts, and instructions for setup and play.

## Game Features
- **Five Unique Levels**: Progress through evolving environments with distinct column arrangements and backgrounds.
- **Physics-Driven Gameplay**: Utilizes Phaser's Arcade Physics engine for realistic gravity, collisions, and bird movement.
- **Dynamic Level Transitions**: Seamlessly updates backgrounds and obstacles as the player advances.
- **Minimalist UI**: Clear instructions and feedback delivered via centered, square-font text overlays.
- **Win Condition**: Reach the end of Level 5 to achieve victory, marked by a celebratory "You Win!" display.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Object-Oriented Design in Phaser
The game leverages Phaser's scene-based architecture, encapsulating functionality into `preload`, `create`, and `update` methods:
- **`preload`**: Loads assets (backgrounds, columns, bird sprites) efficiently using key-based referencing.
- **`create`**: Initializes game objects (bird, columns, road) and sets up physics interactions.
- **`update`**: Handles real-time logic, including input processing, collision detection, and level progression.

This modular structure promotes maintainability and scalability, allowing easy addition of new levels or features.

### 2. Physics and Collision Management
Phaser's Arcade Physics engine drives the game:
- **Gravity**: A downward force (`y: 300`) challenges the player to maintain altitude.
- **Collisions**: The bird interacts with static groups (road, columns) via colliders and overlap checks, triggering game-over states (`hasLanded`, `hasBumped`).
- **Velocity Control**: Player input adjusts the bird's vertical velocity, while horizontal movement is automated, simulating continuous flight.

### 3. Procedural Level Design
Each level introduces a unique column layout:
- **Level 0**: Wide gaps for beginners.
- **Level 4**: Dense, multi-layered obstacles requiring precision.
- The `updateColumns` function dynamically reconfigures column groups based on the current level, showcasing procedural generation within a predefined framework.

### 4. State Management
Global variables (`isGameStarted`, `hasLanded`, `hasBumped`, `level`) track the game state:
- Transitions from idle (pre-start) to active gameplay.
- Detects failure (landing or bumping) or success (reaching `x > 750`).
- Manages level progression and win conditions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Required to serve the game locally.
- **Phaser 3**: Included via CDN or local installation.

### Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd bird-flight
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies** (if using a local server):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Place Assets**:
   - Ensure the `assets/` folder contains:
     - `background.png`, `background1.png`, ..., `background4.png`
     - `column.png`, `column1.png`, ..., `column4.png`
     - `road.png`
     - `bird.png` (spritesheet: 64x96 frames)
4. **Run the Game**:
   - Use a local server (e.g., `npx http-server`) and open `index.html` in a browser.
   - Alternatively, include Phaser via CDN in your HTML:
     ```html
     <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/phaser@3.55.2/dist/phaser.min.js"></script>
     ```

## How to Play
- **Start**: Press the **Up Arrow** to begin.
- **Fly**: Tap the **Up Arrow** (`^`) to lift the bird.
- **Objective**: Navigate through column gaps to reach the right edge (`x > 750`).
- **Levels**: Advance through 5 levels; win by completing Level 5.
- **Game Over**: Crash into columns or land on the road to end the game.

---

## Technical Highlights
- **Asset Management**: Arrays (`backgroundKeys`, `columnKeys`) enable dynamic texture swapping.
- **Responsive Design**: Centered text and scaled assets adapt to the 800x600 canvas.
- **Optimization**: Static groups for columns and roads reduce physics overhead.

---

## Future Enhancements
- **Scoring System**: Track points based on columns passed.
- **Animations**: Add bird flapping via spritesheet frames.
- **Sound Effects**: Integrate audio for jumps, crashes, and level-ups.
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Adjust gravity or column speed per level.

## Credits
- **Framework**: Phaser 3 by Photon Storm.
- **Developer**: [Leux] - A creative exploration of game mechanics and physics.
